            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Embarking on a journey as a frontend developer is both thrilling and challenging. The process of transforming design ideas into interactive websites is a rewarding experience, though it comes with its set of hurdles, especially with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project helps in honing my skills, understanding browser nuances, and solving problems, leading to a richer and more confident approach to web development.
